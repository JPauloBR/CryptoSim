# CryptoSim
#### A crypto currency trading simulator with live prices and user portfolios to track investments

## Synopsis

CryptoSim is an online cryptocurrency trading platform that uses ‘monopoly money’ so users can **test before they invest**. Upon creating an account, users are given $50,000 in ‘monopoly money’ which they can use to invest in any of the 1,800+ cryptocurrencies available.

## Motivation

Trading cryptocurrency can be a scary and abstract concept. We have created this app to help the average person become familiar with trading digital cryptocurrencies without any of the risks associated.
